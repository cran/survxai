Description: Survival models may have very different structures. This package contains functions 
  for creating a unified representation of a 'survival' models, which can be further processed by various 
  survival explainers. Tools implemented in 'survxai' help to understand how input variables are used in 
  the model and what impact do they have on the final model prediction. Currently, four explanation methods are implemented. 
  We can divide them into two groups: local and global. Explanations of the methods can be found in Grudziaz et al.(2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00961>.
